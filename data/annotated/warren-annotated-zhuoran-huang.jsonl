{"comment": "bernie served in the house from 1991 until the time he became a senator in 2007 . over a span of 16 years , he continuously won re-election by larger margins , with the only exception being 1994 . he sided with the minority in voting against the use of force against iraq in 1991 and 2002 . he also opposed the 2003 invasion of iraq . voted against the patriot act despite the majority of congress voting for it ( 357 to 66 ) . he also sponsored several amendments trying to limit its effects , even getting a proposal passed through the house preventing the government from obtaining a record of the books people buy . he passed more amendments than any other member during his time in the house . it earned him the nickname `` the amendment king . '' he did this despite being a `` socialist '' and congress being controlled by republicans from 1994 to 2006 , in one of the most partisan right-wing houses ever . passed an amendment to `` require offenders who are convicted of fraud and other white collar crime to give appropriate notice to victims and other persons in cases where there are multiple victims eligible to receive restitution . '' passed an amendment that improved postsecondary education . it administered a competitive grant program to institutions of higher education seeking to reduce costs through the purchase of goods and services . this saved colleges and taxpayers both money . he expanded free health care and won a $ 100 million increase in funding by using his amendment powers . this added community health centers that gave out a variety of free health care services . prevented child labor by passing an amendment to a general appropriations bill . this stated that the u.s. will not appropriate funds for the importation of goods made by the hands of minors . won a $ 22 million increase for low-income home energy assistance and a related weatherization assistance program . this helped heat homes for the poor . received the distinction of being named the third-most popular senator in the country , according to public policy polling in august 2011 . given a score of 100 percent by the naacp and nhla ( national hispanic leadership agenda ) based on his record during his time in the senate . named one of the top 5 american jews of the forward 50 in 2015 . chairman of the united states senate committee on veterans ' affairs in 2013-2014 . passed an amendment making sure that solar water heaters provide at least 30 percent of hot water for new federal buildings . this is forcing us to use green energy . made sure to it that bailout funds were n't used to replace laid-off u.s. workers with exploited and poorly-paid foreign workers . helped ensure that child care was being offered to parents in the armed forces by requiring the comptroller general to provide accurate reporting on what was being done . required a public database be made available showing the names of senior department officials seeking employment with defense contractors . this helped crack down on corruption . required that the tricare program provide treatment to veterans affected by certain types of autism . it was n't previously being done . was praised by john mccain ( r-az ) and sen. jack reed ( d-ri ) for overhauling the veterans administration . was said to have done such an excellent job of bringing all parties to a deal , that it would n't have gotten done without sanders ' work . but , most of all , what bernie has done is inspire americans . that 's what he 's doing in this election . his list of accomplishments does n't include all the times he 's stood on the senate floor giving a passionate speech on why the `` big banks need to be broken up .

{"comment": "most of the voters who want warren and sanders do n't want biden , so once one of them drops out , all of sudden , biden is waaaayyyyy behind in the polls . not to mention that many of the ppl who support kamala harris are more likely to support warren than biden . the ppl who voted for obama , and then voted for spanky , wldve supported bernie over both hillary and trump , they were working ppl who wanted someone to stop `` business as usual , '' in dc , so if the dems think those voters are gon na leave spanky to vote for biden , they 're sadly mistaken . these moderates the dems are panicking about make up 5 % of the electorate , that 's how much spanky won by in the key blue wall states . in 2018 , the midterms had an 11 % increase in voter participation , esp by the groups the dems have always taken for granted , progressives , college students , lgbt ppl , poor ppl , poc . as 2018 showed , these populations are more likely to vote if you give them candidates to voter for rather than expecting them to vote against the republicans . the dems always think they can throw us a couple bones , while they pant at the feet of the moderates - but the truth is , when ppl are n't excited to vote , with election day on a work day , and a school day , and many dem voters face massive gop voter suppression efforts , it 's easy to stay home on election day . spanky 's cult is motivated , gop voters in general turn out for elections , so most of that 11 % uptick in '18 were dems who do n't normally vote . giving up 11 % to catch 5 % is stupid , it 's doubly stupid considering that same 5 % wanted bernie over hillary . nominate biden , you 're already down 16 % . nominate warren , and you 're up by 16 % . biden is only polling well bc of name recognition , bc the media is pushing him , & bc of the populations who usually get polled . and as we learned in 2016 , polls are n't reliable , certainly not this far out .", "aspects": {}}

{"comment": "a few big differences between warren & bernie : bernie has been committed to medicare for all from the beginning . warren only recently declared she is fully supportive of medicare for all . unlike warren , bernie is committed to small donor fundraising even in the general election . warren has said she would only do small donor fundraising in the primary , so bernie wo n't feel any sort of pressure to bend on his policy stances once elected . warren originally planned on voting for ben carson as secretary of housing , but then flip flopped when she was criticized . warren worked with republicans to repeal the 'medical device tax ' which would have helped defund the aca , in order to appease the medical device industry in her state . unlike warren , bernie has a long history of progressivism dating back to the 60s . warren was a staunch republican up until the late 90s . bernie has also been one of the longest serving members of congress , he was a mayor in vermont , and has a lot of experience in governance compared to warren . warren voted twice to increase the military budget brought forth under pres . trump , which appropriated over $ 81billion for purchase of aircraft , weapons , missiles , and combat vehicles . on top of that it appropriated several billion dollars toward other parts of the dod . bernie wants to cancel all student debt , warren wants to implement a means-tested solution . a means-tested program will likely further split people into the `` haves '' vs. `` have-nots '' and are easier to attack , dismantle , and weaken . take a means-tested program like welfare vs a universal program like social security as an example . welfare is very unpopular whereas social security is very popular . why the differences between sanders and warren matter https : //jacobinmag.com/2019/01/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-socialism-progressives ? fbclid=iwar0h8-boz6jl59kvstkvgvbo-0crqdvq5qanwxmobidt6eytvu_lc_lq4fk that time warren cheered trump . well , this was disappointing ... elizabeth warren gives standing ovation to trump 's promise that `` america will never be a socialist country .

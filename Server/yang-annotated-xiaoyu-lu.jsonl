{"comment": "i mean yes i agree this point but i cant get align with his idea to reform our constitution and 2nd amendment . if you tamper with any of the bill of rights your messing with the biggest stepping stones that allowed many of us americans get ahead and become a great country . andrew please dont go against my amendment rights and we can talk . deal with issues not rights . people who havent seen his talk about 2nd amendment and constitution reform ideas please do so . i got shocked hearing it from him . it gave me doubts . i didnt vote for trump , i am democrat affiliated but wondering right now i thought i could with yang but now i am not sure . just not sure . we need to stand together as americans for someone who fixes our actual core issues and take a step backwards away from infringement of our rights . my heart goes out to virginia gun ban . new york trying to do the same along with california . we talking about states who dont care about its citizens instead of fixing economical issues and actual root issues like bullying in schools and single parent households being made like normal . if your a single woman they tell you to stay that way because your strong and need to be independent and the government will provide financial help but please i saw my mother struggle she needed help we need good men to support good women to build a better family structure and building a better future for our young kids growing up . i was raised good thanks to a strong family . uncles who where good role models from engineers and military people to in home dads . its about a united america . united states of america . key word is united . we need our rights untouched and to work together to form solutions . bill of rights leave it alone . make more constitutional rights like the right for us to look into police investigations more closely to be disclosed to the public should be a good . how about open book of earnings of these politicians who serve us the people and we see if they get a pay increase and why and where is the money coming from . this should be open for us to see . not for us to wonder and do research on . we all have to become investigators to do this sht its ridiculous they work for us not the other way around .", "aspects": {"target_yang": ["general_negative"]}}
